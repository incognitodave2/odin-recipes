# odin-recipes

The first Odin Project, project! This project is aimed to be a rough website represting the knowledge we have already learned. 
It should use images, links, paragraphs, text, strong, em, etc...

The website will have 3 recipes of my own choosing and I will describe instructions, ingredients, and a description of what to expect.

Thanks!
